- line fitting for 2D and 3D points
- polynomial

- Should the difference between points and vectors be removed? algs seem to turn points into
vectors on a whim.

--------
Split into these packages:
- Structures
  * data structures
  * tests for equality
  * other basic stuff
- metric
  * distance between objects
  * closest point between objects
- fitting
  * best fit motion given associated points
  * best fit lines

Don't get into robust techniques, such as RANSAC
No iterative, only closed form solutions for now
